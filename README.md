This project includes a website for an online store of electrical goods.
Created using the react library and connection to the database (phpMyadmin).

How to run the project :
- download the project zip file and open it in Visual Studio Code
- install xampp, find the "htdocs" folder in the local files and create a folder there called "my-store-api" 
- transfer all php files to the "my-store-api" folder 
- launch phpMyadmin and import the database "store.db (final)"
- run the website locally in the terminal :
cd shop
npm start

Thank you for your attention.
